chehak            react  states and props


function component   does not have states
nor they have  constructors

setState({name:"Ravi", age"2"})
clik={setState}

but   using hooks  in function component makes  function component
statefull
to create    function component use   function keyword
and write   view  logic   return statement
It  does not have  render method


JSX

Java script xml

used to write  html in react
don't use   capital  letter tags  for html
u  MUST HAVE a single parent  tag

babel  is a transpiler  transpiles  the
JSX into  js (ES5)   





states

represents  the  attributes  of the  Object

these are  avaialble  only  to class  components
u can change the state  of the  component using
setState() method
class   components  are also called  statefull  components


constructor   in class compoenents

we can also  declare / initialize state  in   constructor
in construcor  always   decalre   state  using this  keyword
below  we have  super()
which calls the  Super class  React.Components  constructor

props
defines the  properties  of the   component
we can pass  props in   function component also
and  in class  component also
In  class component  we pass  props  keyword
in  constructor() and super

Syntax
class   MyComponent extends ReactComponent
{
    constructor(props)
 {
    super(props);
    states
}
}
while   accessing props  in class  components  u use   
this.props.propertynameofcomponent

Eg   Car  is  a component
 <Car   brand="hyundai"/>
  here  brand is  props
u can access    brand  in Car  using  this.props.brand


acccessing props   in  function   components

   function   Fun(props)
{
    return (<h1>{props.propertyname}</h1>);
  }
   since   function components  don't have any states

   don't  access  props  using  this   key word


If  any  component   does  not have property then   u can acces
through  defaultProps

Syntax
Componentname.defaultProps={}



using   props  and  states   together


React  EVENTS


events are  nothing but change in state of the Component
in  java  scripts   events are  fired by

function   add()
{}
<button onclick="add()">click</button>

But in React   Events are  fired   by
<button   onClick={add}></button>


if the   events  of  functions are  ARROW   functions  then
u can directly call
else
u need to bind() with  this  key word in constructor

I can change the  state  by using   setState method
